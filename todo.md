# Todo list

- [ ] environment var for docker ports
- [ ] which header from requests should I allow in production?
- [ ] think of how can I automate creating virtual env to help setup the project fast
- [ ] (theory) should I use the container's nginx instead of my own machine if I were to go on prem?
- 

## Memos

- nginx config file: `/opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`
